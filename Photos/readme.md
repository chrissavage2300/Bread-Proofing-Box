Fan looks pretty small, around 60mm I'd say. I probably wont need that big of a fan for the intake like I suspected.

This seems to be some sort of buck SMPS. The datasheet I found suggests it puts out 12V, which confirms my initial suspicions that this is nothing more than those PTC heaters I found on ebay. I think I can use this to power my microcontroller circuit.
